## About the project

This is a quick tool for Fuzer Dota 2 Cup to display bans from earlier games in stream. Idea is to crop ban columns as browser sources with OBS and use hero icons next to them to control bans.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
